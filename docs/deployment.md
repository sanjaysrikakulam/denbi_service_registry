# Deployment Guide

> **Configuration:** see [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for all settings including branding, contact email, and feature flags. — de.NBI Service Registry

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2
- A hostname with DNS pointing to your server (e.g. `service-registry.bi.denbi.de`)
- TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Access to an SMTP server for email notifications

---

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. There are no TOML config files to edit.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the three required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required — startup fails without these:**

| Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SECRET_KEY`     | Django secret key — generate with `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"` |
| `DB_PASSWORD`    | PostgreSQL password — must match `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` used to initialise the DB volume                                                          |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis password                                                                                                                                 |

Everything else has sensible defaults for development. See `.env.example` for the full reference.

## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/denbi/service-registry.git
cd service-registry

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD

# 3. Build and start services
#    Migrations run automatically on container start.
#    On a fresh database, EDAM (~3,400 terms) is seeded automatically (~30 s).
make build
make dev

# 4. Create the first admin user
make superuser

# 5. Visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Production Deployment

!!! note "Ansible-managed production"
    The de.NBI production environment is deployed via Ansible. The Ansible role
    (`roles/registry/templates/docker-compose.yml.j2`) generates the authoritative
    production compose file and manages `.env` via vault. The steps below describe
    the infrastructure assumptions — consult the Ansible role for the actual
    deployment procedure.

### Architecture

| Component | How deployed |
|---|---|
| Django (Gunicorn) | Docker container — image from `crate.bi.denbi.de/denbi/denbi-service-registry:stable` |
| Celery worker + beat | Docker containers — same image |
| Redis | Docker container — broker + rate-limit cache |
| PostgreSQL | External managed instance — not a Docker container |
| Nginx + TLS | Host-managed — terminates HTTPS, proxies to Gunicorn on port 8000 |
| `config/site.toml` | Bind-mounted from `/data/denbi-service-registry/config/site.toml` — rebranding requires no image rebuild |

### Step 1 — Configure environment

On the production server, create `.env` with production values (managed by Ansible vault):

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<generate-a-long-random-key>
DB_NAME=denbi_registry
DB_USER=denbi
DB_HOST=<external-postgres-host>
DB_PORT=5432
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
REDIS_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>

DEBUG=false
ALLOWED_HOSTS=service-registry.bi.denbi.de

EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-provider.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-smtp-user
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@denbi.de

ADMIN_URL_PREFIX=your-secret-admin-path
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=<nginx-server-ip>
```

### Step 2 — TLS and Nginx

TLS termination is handled by the host Nginx. Traffic flows:

```
Internet → host Nginx (port 443, TLS) → Gunicorn (web:8000, Docker-internal)
```

Configure the host Nginx vhost to proxy to `localhost:8000`. See `nginx/host/` for
a reference vhost configuration. Let's Encrypt is recommended for TLS:

```bash
certbot certonly --standalone -d service-registry.bi.denbi.de
```

### Step 3 — Start production services

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

!!! info "Migrations and EDAM seeding are automatic"
    The `web` container entrypoint runs `manage.py migrate --noinput` before starting.
    On a fresh database this also seeds the EDAM ontology (~3,400 terms, ~30 s).
    Worker and beat containers set `SKIP_MIGRATE=true` so they do not race web on startup.

!!! info "Static files are baked into the image"
    `collectstatic` runs at Docker build time — no separate `collectstatic` step needed.

!!! warning "SKIP_MIGRATE on worker and beat"
    The Ansible-generated compose must set `SKIP_MIGRATE: "true"` in the environment
    of `worker` and `beat` services. Without this, all three containers race to run
    migrations simultaneously on a fresh database, causing a PostgreSQL `UniqueViolation`
    error. The `web` service is the sole migration runner.

---

## Migrations

The `web` container entrypoint runs `manage.py migrate --noinput` automatically before
Gunicorn starts. Worker and beat containers skip this step (`SKIP_MIGRATE=true`) to
avoid a race condition on fresh databases.

To run migrations manually (e.g. to pre-apply before a rolling restart):

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
# or via Makefile (dev overlay):
make prod-migrate
```

Migrations are tracked in version control under `apps/*/migrations/`. Never edit generated migration files manually.

---

## Initial Data (Fixtures)

Seed the PI list and service centres:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py loaddata apps/registry/fixtures/initial_pis.json
docker compose exec web python manage.py loaddata apps/registry/fixtures/initial_centres.json
```

(Fixture files to be created separately with the full de.NBI PI list.)

---

## EDAM Ontology Seeding

The EDAM ontology (~3,400 terms) powers the Topic and Operation dropdowns on the
registration form. The application handles seeding in three ways — no manual step
is required on a standard first deployment.

### Automatic seeding on first migrate

When `manage.py migrate` runs against a **fresh database** (empty `EdamTerm` table),
it automatically downloads and imports EDAM from `EDAM_OWL_URL`. This happens as
a `post_migrate` signal — you will see progress output at the end of `migrate`:

```
[edam] EdamTerm table is empty — running initial EDAM sync.
[edam] This downloads ~3 MB from edamontology.org and may take ~30 seconds.
[edam] Loading EDAM from: https://edamontology.org/EDAM_stable.owl
...
[edam] Auto-seed complete — 3471 terms loaded (EDAM 1.25).
```

On subsequent `migrate` runs (e.g. applying a new migration), the table is not
empty so the signal is a no-op.

### Ongoing automatic updates

Celery beat runs a full EDAM sync **every 30 days** automatically. EDAM releases
are infrequent (~1–2 per year) so monthly is more than sufficient.

### Manual sync

Force a sync at any time via:

- **Admin UI**: Go to **EDAM Ontology → EDAM Terms** and click **↻ Sync EDAM from upstream**.
  The sync runs as a background Celery task; refresh the page after ~30 seconds.

- **CLI**:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam
  ```

Verify the current state:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c \
  "from apps.edam.models import EdamTerm; t = EdamTerm.objects.first(); print(EdamTerm.objects.count(), 'terms, version', t.edam_version)"
```

### Air-gapped / firewall-restricted servers

If the server cannot reach edamontology.org, download the OWL file on another machine
and copy it across:

```bash
# On a machine with internet access:
curl -o EDAM.owl https://edamontology.org/EDAM_stable.owl
# Copy EDAM.owl to the server, then:
```

Either set the path permanently in `.env`:

```bash
EDAM_OWL_URL=/app/EDAM.owl
```

Or pass it once to the management command:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam --url /app/EDAM.owl
```

The auto-seed on first migrate also respects `EDAM_OWL_URL`, so an air-gapped
deployment works without any code changes.

## Network Requirements

| Destination        | Port | When needed                       | Purpose                |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `bio.tools`        | 443  | On form submission + daily        | bio.tools API sync     |
| `edamontology.org` | 443  | Manual `sync_edam` runs only      | EDAM ontology download |
| Your SMTP server   | 587  | On every submission/status change | Email notifications    |

---

## Updating the Application

In the Ansible-managed production environment, Ansible handles image pulls and container
restarts. For manual updates:

```bash
# Pull the new image (Ansible sets image tag to :stable)
docker compose pull

# Restart containers — web entrypoint applies pending migrations automatically
docker compose up -d --no-deps web worker beat

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready/
docker compose logs web --tail 50
```

---

## Logo

To display your organisation logo in the navbar:

1. Place your logo file at `static/img/logo.png` (or `.svg`, `.jpg`)
2. Rebuild static files: `make collectstatic`

Or set `LOGO_URL` in `.env` to point to any image URL:

```bash
# Local static file (after collectstatic)
LOGO_URL=/static/img/logo.png

# External URL
LOGO_URL=https://www.denbi.de/images/logos/denbi-logo.png
```

Recommended logo height is 38px. The image renders in the top-left of the navbar
alongside the site name text.

---

## Backup

### Database

```bash
# Backup
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U denbi denbi_registry > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Restore
docker compose exec -T db psql -U denbi denbi_registry < backup_20260306.sql
```

### Redis

Redis holds only transient Celery queue data and does not need persistent backup.

- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` is unique and at least 50 characters
- [ ] Strong passwords for `DB_PASSWORD` and `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- [ ] TLS certificate installed and auto-renewal configured
- [ ] HSTS preload submitted to [hstspreload.org](https://hstspreload.org)
- [ ] `ADMIN_URL_PREFIX` changed from default `admin-denbi`
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set to production hostname only
- [ ] All containers running as non-root (`docker compose ps` → verify USER column)
- [ ] `pip-audit` passes: `make audit`
- [ ] Health checks passing: `curl https://service-registry.bi.denbi.de/health/ready/`
- [ ] Test email notification by submitting a test form

---

## Troubleshooting

**Web service not starting:**

```bash
docker compose logs web
# Common causes: missing SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, or REDIS_PASSWORD in .env
# The startup error will name the missing variable explicitly
```

**Database authentication failure:**

```bash
# Verify what password Django is using
docker compose exec web python -c "
from django.conf import settings
d = settings.DATABASES['default'].copy()
d['PASSWORD'] = '***'
print(d)
"
# Production: DB_HOST points to the external PostgreSQL instance — verify DB_HOST,
# DB_PORT, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD in .env match the external server's credentials.
# Development: make sure DB_PASSWORD in .env matches the password the DB volume was
# initialised with. If unsure, wipe the volume and start fresh: make nuke
```

**Emails not sending:**

```bash
docker compose logs worker
docker compose exec worker python -c \
  "from django.core.mail import send_mail; send_mail('test','test','from@example.com',['to@example.com'])"
```

**Rate limit 429 errors in testing:**

```bash
# Increase limits in .env:
RATE_LIMIT_SUBMIT=1000/h
RATE_LIMIT_UPDATE=1000/h
```

**EDAM dropdowns empty:**

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam
```
