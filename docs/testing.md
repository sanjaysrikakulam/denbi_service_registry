# Testing

## Running tests

```bash
# Full test suite with coverage (requires ≥ 80%)
conda run -n denbi-registry pytest tests/

# Or via make:
make test

# HTML coverage report
make test-cov
# then open htmlcov/index.html
```

Tests use SQLite in-memory and local-memory cache. No PostgreSQL, Redis, or external network access is required.

---

## Test configuration

**`pytest.ini`** — points to `config.settings_test` and enables coverage by default:

```ini
[pytest]
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = config.settings_test
addopts = -v --tb=short --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

**`config/settings_test.py`** — key overrides:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASES` | SQLite `:memory:` | Zero setup, fast |
| `CACHES` | `LocMemCache` | No Redis needed |
| `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` | `True` | Tasks run synchronously |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | `locmem` | Emails captured in `mail.outbox` |
| `PASSWORD_HASHERS` | MD5 | Fast hashing in tests |
| `RATELIMIT_ENABLE` | `False` | No throttle blocking mid-suite |
| `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` | `[]` | No DRF throttling |

---

## Test files

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `test_models.py` | `ServiceSubmission`, `SubmissionAPIKey` validation, sanitisation, sensitive fields |
| `test_views.py` | Registration form, update flow, session handling, health endpoints |
| `test_forms.py` | `SubmissionForm` required fields, cross-field rules, URL validation |
| `test_api.py` | All REST endpoints — auth, permissions, response shape, error envelopes |
| `test_security.py` | API key auth, logging scrubber, CSRF, request ID middleware |
| `test_tasks.py` | Celery email notification and cleanup tasks |
| `test_biotools.py` | bio.tools client (HTTP mocks), sync logic, tasks, signals, views |
| `test_management_commands.py` | `sync_edam`, `sync_biotools` management commands, template tags, context processor |

---

## Factories

`tests/factories.py` provides `factory_boy` factories for all models:

```python
from tests.factories import ServiceSubmissionFactory, APIKeyFactory

# Creates a complete submission with all required fields
submission = ServiceSubmissionFactory()

# Override specific fields
submission = ServiceSubmissionFactory(
    service_name="My Service",
    biotools_url="",   # empty so signal doesn't trigger sync
)

# Create an API key with the plaintext for testing auth
key, plaintext = APIKeyFactory.create_with_plaintext(submission=submission)
```

!!! warning "Signal side effect"
    Creating a `ServiceSubmissionFactory` with a non-empty `biotools_url` triggers the
    `post_save` signal, which runs `sync_biotools_record` eagerly (Celery eager mode).
    If you need to test sync separately, create the submission with `biotools_url=""`
    and trigger sync manually.

---

## Writing new tests

### Standard test class structure

```python
import pytest
from tests.factories import ServiceSubmissionFactory

@pytest.mark.django_db
class TestMyFeature:

    def test_something(self):
        submission = ServiceSubmissionFactory()
        # ... assertions
```

### Mocking HTTP calls

Never make real network calls in tests. Use `unittest.mock.patch`:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_biotools_client():
    with patch("urllib.request.urlopen") as mock_urlopen:
        mock_resp = MagicMock()
        mock_resp.read.return_value = b'{"name": "BLAST"}'
        mock_resp.__enter__ = lambda s: s
        mock_resp.__exit__ = MagicMock(return_value=False)
        mock_urlopen.return_value = mock_resp

        client = BioToolsClient()
        # test client behaviour...
```

### Mocking Celery tasks

Tasks with internal imports need to be patched at the source module, not at the point of import:

```python
# In tasks.py: from .sync import sync_tool
# Correct patch target:
with patch("apps.biotools.sync.sync_tool", return_value=expected):
    result = sync_biotools_record(str(submission.pk))
```

### Testing API endpoints

```python
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from tests.factories import ServiceSubmissionFactory, APIKeyFactory

@pytest.mark.django_db
class TestMyEndpoint:

    def setup_method(self):
        self.client = APIClient()

    def test_requires_auth(self):
        response = self.client.get("/api/v1/submissions/some-id/")
        assert response.status_code in (401, 403)

    def test_with_valid_key(self):
        submission = ServiceSubmissionFactory(biotools_url="")
        key, plaintext = APIKeyFactory.create_with_plaintext(submission=submission)
        self.client.credentials(HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=f"ApiKey {plaintext}")
        response = self.client.get(f"/api/v1/submissions/{submission.pk}/")
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Testing email dispatch

```python
from django.core import mail

def test_sends_email(self):
    # ... trigger action that sends email
    assert len(mail.outbox) == 1
    assert "My Service" in mail.outbox[0].subject
```

## Coverage

The coverage threshold is **80%** enforced by `--cov-fail-under=80` in `pytest.ini`. The CI pipeline fails if coverage drops below this.

Current coverage by module (approximate):

| Module | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `api/` | ~90% |
| `biotools/` | ~90% |
| `submissions/models.py` | ~95% |
| `submissions/forms.py` | ~88% |
| `submissions/views.py` | ~72% |
| `submissions/admin.py` | ~39% (admin UI is hard to test) |
| `edam/management/commands/sync_edam.py` | ~91% |

Admin code is intentionally at lower coverage — Django's admin class methods require
a running admin site with a logged-in superuser, which adds significant test setup complexity
with limited return value.
