# Admin Guide — de.NBI Service Registry

## Accessing the Admin Portal

The admin is available at `/<ADMIN_URL_PREFIX>/` (default: `/admin-denbi/`).
The URL prefix is configured via the `ADMIN_URL_PREFIX` environment variable in `.env` (default: `admin-denbi`).

Log in with your Django superuser credentials.

---

## Managing Submissions

### Submission List View

The list shows: service name, submitter, status badge, service centre, ELIXIR-DE flag, submission date.

**Filters** (right sidebar): status, category, service centre, ELIXIR-DE flag, date range.
**Search** (top): service name, submitter name, PI name, host institute.

### Submission Detail View

The detail view shows all form sections A–G plus:
- Submission metadata (ID, timestamps, IP — IP visible only to superusers)
- EDAM Topics and EDAM Operations annotations selected by the submitter
- **bio.tools Record** section (if a bio.tools URL was entered) — see [bio.tools Records](#biotools-records)
- API key management section at the bottom

### Changing Submission Status

**Individual:** Open a submission, change the Status field, and save. Two emails are sent automatically:

- **Admin notification** — sent to the registry coordination address (`[contact] email` in `site.toml`), CC'd to `SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_CC` if configured.
- **Submitter notification** — sent directly to the `internal_contact_email` of the submission with a plain-language status update ("Your service has been approved / was not approved at this time"). This is separate from the admin email so the submitter receives a clear, action-oriented message rather than the full internal report.

**Bulk:** Select submissions in the list view, then choose an action from the dropdown:
- Approve selected submissions
- Reject selected submissions
- Mark selected as Under Review

### Exporting Submissions

Select submissions → choose **Export selected as CSV** or **Export selected as JSON**.
Exported files contain public fields only (no internal contact emails).

---

## API Key Management

Each submission detail page shows the **Submission API Keys** section. This shows all keys ever issued, their label, creation date, last-used timestamp, and whether they are active.

### Three admin actions are available:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Revoke all keys** | Deactivates all active keys. The submitter can no longer edit their submission until a new key is issued. |
| **Reset key** | Revokes all keys and issues one new one. The new plaintext key is shown **once** in a banner. Communicate it to the submitter securely (e.g. encrypted email, phone). |
| **Issue additional key** | Creates a new active key alongside existing ones. Useful for CI/CD pipelines or team members. Enter a descriptive label. |

> **Security note:** Key plaintexts are shown once in the admin interface and are never stored anywhere. If you accidentally close the browser before noting the key, you must reset again.

All key operations are logged in Django's admin audit log (History tab on the submission).

---

## Managing Reference Data

Reference data (PIs, service centres, categories) can be managed in two ways:

- **Admin UI** — the Django admin portal (see below)
- **REST API** — `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/pis/`, `/api/v1/service-centers/`, `/api/v1/categories/` — useful for bulk onboarding or automation (see [API Guide](api-guide.md#reference-data-categories-service-centres-pis))

Both interfaces support soft-delete: `DELETE` via the API (or setting `is_active = False` in the admin) hides the record from the registration form but keeps it linked to existing submissions.

### Principal Investigators (PIs)

**Location:** Admin → Reference Data → Principal Investigators

- Add new PIs who are not yet listed.
- Set `is_active = False` to hide a PI from the form dropdown without removing them from existing submissions.
- The `is_associated_partner` flag should be `True` for exactly one entry (the generic "Associated partner" option).
- ORCID iDs are validated on save.

### Service Centres

**Location:** Admin → Reference Data → Service Centers

- Each centre has a short name (e.g. "HD-HuB"), full name, and optional website.
- `is_active = False` hides from the form but keeps existing submission links intact.

### Service Categories

**Location:** Admin → Reference Data → Service Categories

- Add new category types as needed.
- `is_active = False` hides from the form.

---

## Customising Form Help Text & Tooltips

The registration form displays two types of guidance for each field:

- **Help text** — a short hint shown below the input field.
- **Tooltip** — a detailed explanation shown when hovering or clicking the info icon next to the label.

Both are controlled from a single YAML file:

```
apps/submissions/form_texts.yaml
```

### Editing the file

Each field entry looks like this:

```yaml
service_name:
  help: "Official name of the service."
  tooltip: "Use the canonical name as it appears on your website. Avoid abbreviations unless they are the official name."
```

- Set `help: ""` to hide the help text below a field.
- Set `tooltip: ""` to hide the info icon for that field.
- Use plain text only — no HTML or Markdown.

### Deploying changes

After editing `form_texts.yaml`, rebuild the container image and redeploy:

```bash
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web
```

No code changes, no migrations, no template edits required.

---

## Customising Email Notification Text

Email subject lines and status messages sent to submitters are controlled from a
single YAML file:

```
apps/submissions/email_texts.yaml
```

### Subjects

The `subjects` section defines the subject line for each email type.
Placeholders `{service_name}` and `{status}` are replaced automatically:

```yaml
subjects:
  created: "[de.NBI Registry] New service submission: {service_name}"
  status_changed: "[de.NBI Registry] Status updated to '{status}': {service_name}"
  updated: "[de.NBI Registry] Update: {service_name}"
  submitter_status: "Your service registration status: {status} — {service_name}"
```

### Status messages

The `status_messages` section provides the body text included in the submitter
notification when an admin changes the submission status.
A `default` fallback is used for any status not explicitly listed:

```yaml
status_messages:
  approved: "Your service has been approved and is now registered …"
  rejected: "Your service registration was not approved at this time …"
  under_review: "Your submission is currently under review …"
  default: "If you have questions about your submission, please contact us."
```

### Deploying changes

After editing `email_texts.yaml`, rebuild and redeploy — same as form text
changes:

```bash
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web
```

No code changes, no migrations, no template edits required.

## EDAM Ontology Management {#edam-management}

**Location:** Admin → EDAM Ontology → EDAM Terms

EDAM terms are imported from the official EDAM ontology release and are read-only in the admin.
Terms cannot be added or deleted manually — all changes come through a sync.

### How seeding works

| Trigger | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-seed on first migrate** | Once, on a fresh database | Fires automatically as a `post_migrate` signal when the `EdamTerm` table is empty. Downloads ~3 MB, takes ~30 s. |
| **Monthly beat schedule** | Every 30 days | Celery beat task `edam.sync` keeps terms current as EDAM publishes new releases. |
| **Admin "Sync EDAM" button** | On demand | Queues a background Celery task. Useful after a known EDAM release or if the automatic sync failed. |
| **CLI** | On demand | `python manage.py sync_edam` — synchronous, progress shown in terminal. |

### Viewing Terms

The list shows: accession (e.g. `topic_0121`), label, branch, obsolete flag, EDAM version.

Filter by **branch** to see only topics, operations, data types, formats, or identifiers.
Search by label or definition text.

### Checking the Loaded Version

The **EDAM version** column shows which release each term was last loaded from (e.g. `1.25`).
All terms should show the same version after a successful sync.

### Triggering a manual sync

**From the admin UI** (recommended — no shell access needed):

1. Go to **EDAM Ontology → EDAM Terms**
2. Click **↻ Sync EDAM from upstream** in the top-right toolbar
3. A green message confirms the task was queued
4. Refresh the page after ~30 seconds to see the updated term count and version

**From the CLI**:

```bash
# Download and import the latest stable release
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam

# Dry-run — parse and count terms without writing to the database
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam --dry-run

# Sync a single branch only
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam --branch topic

# Load from a local file (air-gapped servers)
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam --url /app/EDAM.owl
```

New terms appear immediately in the form. Obsolete terms are hidden from the form but
retained in the database so existing submissions referencing them are not broken.

### If the Form Shows No EDAM Terms

On a standard deployment this should not happen — the auto-seed fires on first migrate.
If the dropdowns are empty, check the term count:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c \
  "from apps.edam.models import EdamTerm; print(EdamTerm.objects.count())"
# Expected: ~3400. If 0, the auto-seed failed (check migrate output for [edam] lines).
# Fix: docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_edam
```

## bio.tools Record Management {#biotools-records}

When a submitter enters a bio.tools URL, the system automatically fetches and stores a local
copy of the tool's bio.tools entry. This is displayed in the submission detail view and
exposed in the API.

### Viewing bio.tools Records

**Location:** Admin → bio.tools Integration → bio.tools Records

Each record shows:
- The linked submission
- The bio.tools ID and link to bio.tools
- Extracted metadata: name, description, license, tool types, maturity
- EDAM topic URIs sourced from bio.tools
- Last sync timestamp and any sync error

The **Functions** inline shows all EDAM Operation/Input/Output annotations from bio.tools,
structured as one row per function block.

### Sync Status

The list view shows a green ✓ or red ✗ for each record's last sync status.
A red ✗ means the last sync failed — check the **sync_error** field on the record.

Common sync errors:
- `bio.tools tool not found (HTTP 404)` — the bio.tools ID in the submission URL is wrong
- `bio.tools network error` — the server could not reach bio.tools (check firewall/proxy)
- `bio.tools API error (HTTP 5xx)` — bio.tools is temporarily unavailable; will retry automatically

### Manually Triggering a Sync

From the admin list, select records and choose **Sync selected records from bio.tools now**.
This queues a background Celery task; the record refreshes within a few seconds.

From the command line:

```bash
# Sync all records
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_biotools

# Sync one specific submission
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_biotools --submission <uuid>

# Dry-run
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_biotools --dry-run
```

### Creating a bio.tools Record Manually

If a submission has a bio.tools URL but no record was created (e.g. bio.tools was unreachable
when the submission was saved), create it manually:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_biotools \
  --submission <submission-uuid> \
  --create
```

### Stale Draft Cleanup {#stale-drafts}

Submissions left in `draft` status (saved but never submitted) are automatically purged
by the `cleanup_stale_drafts` Celery beat task, which runs daily at **03:00 UTC**.

The default retention period is **30 days** — drafts older than 30 days are deleted permanently.

To change the retention period, edit `STALE_DRAFT_DAYS` in `config/settings.py`:

```python
STALE_DRAFT_DAYS = 30  # days; set to 0 to disable automatic cleanup
```

To trigger cleanup manually:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.submissions.tasks import cleanup_stale_drafts
result = cleanup_stale_drafts()
print(result)
"
```

---

### Periodic Sync Schedule

All bio.tools records are refreshed automatically every 24 hours by a Celery beat task.
To verify the scheduler is running:

```bash
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect scheduled
# Should show the biotools.sync_all task
```

To change the schedule, edit `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` in `config/settings.py`:

```python
"sync-biotools-daily": {
    "task": "biotools.sync_all",
    "schedule": 86400,  # seconds — change to 43200 for twice-daily
},
```

---

## Issuing Admin API Tokens

For staff or external systems needing read-all API access:

1. Go to **Admin → Auth Token → Tokens → Add Token**.
2. Select the staff user and save.
3. The full token is displayed **once only** in a warning banner with a
   **Copy to clipboard** button — copy it before navigating away.
4. The consumer uses: `Authorization: Token <token-value>` in API requests.

To revoke: delete the token record from the admin.

!!! warning "Token visibility"
    For security, token keys are **masked** throughout the admin interface.
    The token list shows only the first 8 characters (e.g. `a3f7b2c1…`),
    and the change view never displays the full key. The complete token is
    shown exactly once — at the moment of creation. If lost, delete the
    token and create a new one.

---

## Email Notification Settings

Emails are sent asynchronously via Celery. Configure via environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@denbi.de
SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_CC=admin@denbi.de          # Optional CC on every notification
SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_OVERRIDE=                  # Override recipient for testing
```

Events that trigger emails:

| Event | Recipient(s) | Template |
|---|---|---|
| New submission created | Admin + `SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_CC` (CC: `internal_contact_email`) | `notification.html` |
| Submitter edits via update form | Admin + `SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_CC` | `notification.html` |
| Status changed by admin | Admin + `SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_CC` **and** `internal_contact_email` (separate submitter email) | `notification.html` + `status_update_submitter.html` |

The submitter email on status change is suppressed when `SUBMISSION_NOTIFY_OVERRIDE` is set (e.g. in staging/testing), so test environments do not accidentally send submitter-facing emails.

---

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

- `GET /health/live/` — 200 if the process is running (no DB check)
- `GET /health/ready/` — 200 only if DB and Redis are reachable; 503 otherwise

### Logs

Logs are structured JSON on stdout (captured by Docker). Key fields:
`timestamp`, `levelname`, `name`, `message`, `request_id`.

View live logs:
```bash
make logs
# or
docker compose logs -f web
docker compose logs -f worker
```

### Celery / Task Queue

Check task queue health:
```bash
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect active
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect stats

# Check scheduled tasks (should include cleanup-stale-drafts, sync-biotools-daily, sync-edam-monthly)
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect scheduled

# Ping the worker directly (same check used by the Docker healthcheck)
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect ping
```

The `worker` container reports a Docker health status based on `celery inspect ping`. The `beat` container has no inspection API so its healthcheck is disabled — liveness is inferred from the process staying up.

---

## Rotating the SECRET_KEY

1. Generate a new key: `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`
2. Update `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` (or your deployment environment / CI secret store).
3. Restart the web and worker services: `docker compose restart web worker`
4. All existing sessions will be invalidated (users will need to log in again).

## Rotating Database Password

1. Update the PostgreSQL password: `docker compose exec db psql -U denbi -c "ALTER USER denbi PASSWORD 'new-password';"`
2. Update `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env` to the new password.
3. Restart services: `docker compose restart web worker beat`
